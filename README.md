# grant-manager-tool-demo

Utility repository containing `wrangle_grants.py` for merging and normalizing grant CSV/TSV files.
An optional `wrangle_grants_gui.py` provides a minimal Tkinter interface to run the wrangler without the command line.
The GUI now starts with a simple login screen demonstrating "admin" and
"user" roles.  The admin account can adjust weighting and deadline fields
while the standard user can only choose files and run the wrangler.

Default credentials:

```
username: admin   password: adminpass
username: user    password: userpass
```

See [README_wrangle_grants.md](README_wrangle_grants.md) for usage instructions.

## Browser visualization

For a quick way to explore wrangled data in your browser, run the small Flask
app:

```bash
python visualize_grants_web.py
```

It looks for `out/master.csv` generated by `wrangle_grants.py` and shows a bar
chart of total funding per grant. If the CSV is missing, the page falls back to
sample data so the visualization can still be demoed.

## Beginner installation

If you're new to Python or Node.js, the following steps walk through a fresh
setup of the project:

1. Install [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and
   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if they are not already on your machine.
2. Clone the repository and change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/grant-manager-tool-demo.git
   cd grant-manager-tool-demo
   ```
3. Create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install the
   dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. (Optional) Initialize a Node project and install dependencies for the
   Cloudflare Worker example:

   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

5. (Optional) Install Node dependencies for the Cloudflare Worker example:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

After these steps the `wrangle_grants.py` script and the optional Cloudflare
Worker demo can be run using the commands shown below.

## Python environment

The wrangling scripts require Python 3.9+ with `pandas` and `openpyxl`.
Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Cloudflare Worker demo

A minimal Cloudflare Worker is provided for quickly publishing a demo endpoint.
The worker includes a basic login page (credentials match the GUI: `admin/adminpass` and
`user/userpass`) and, once logged in, shows sample grant data in a timeline table plus a
bar chart of funding amounts. It can be extended to invoke the Python wrangler or serve a
richer UI. To deploy:

```bash
npm install            # install wrangler locally
npm run deploy        # publishes worker.js using wrangler.toml

# or, if wrangler is installed globally
npm install -g wrangler  # one-time install
wrangler publish         # deploys worker.js using wrangler.toml
```

To connect the dashboard to your own grant or partnership data, set the
`GRANT_DATA_URL` variable in `wrangler.toml` to a JSON API endpoint returning an
array of grant objects with `title`, `amount`, `start`, and `end` fields. The
worker will fetch this URL at runtime and fall back to sample data if the fetch
fails.
